Recognition of Handwritten Digits with Artificial Neural Networks
Handwriting are difficult to recognize by computer systems or any rule based system as the variation in the shape and sizes of their font vary person to person, therefore I am trying to solve this problem with the help the machine learning. For this I have to train a artificial neural network model on the images of different characters font images. And after that it can be implement in the real world problem.
